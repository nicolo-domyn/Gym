# [CUSTOM-PATCHES] This vendored OpenHands checkout is patched in place (literal
# find-and-replace against the OpenHands code). Each patch script is idempotent, all applied
# unconditionally here, regardless of which dataset(s) are actually used during training:
#   - swesmith_dataset_type: adds a dedicated 'SWE-smith' DATASET_TYPE
#   - swerebench_v1_skip_entry: adds plain SWE-rebench (V1) to SKIP_ENTRY_SCRIPT_TYPES, so
#     OpenHands' default entry script doesn't destroy app.py's pre-populated workspace bind mount.
#     Must run after the SWE-smith patch above -- both touch the same tuple.
#   - isolate_shared_venv_by_default: makes every dataset (not just language=="python" ones)
#     isolate its agent actions from the shared, persistent OpenHands orchestrator venv --
#     fixes a real cross-job venv corruption incident (one rollout's pip activity leaking into
#     another's).
#   - pythonunbuffered: forces PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 so a crash during run_infer.py's own startup
#     surfaces a real traceback
#   - swebench_pin: fixes poetry.lock's `swebench` git dependency pin, which points at a commit
#     that's no longer fetchable. Must run before `make build` below.
